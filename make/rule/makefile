.PHONY: first depends depended depended2

#whatever its name, the first rule is the default if no args

#however, `all` is a very standard name whith you should use
first:
	@echo first

#depends first call `depended` and `depened2`
depends: depended depended2
	@echo depends
	#target name:
	@echo "$@"
	#first dep:
	@echo "$<"

depended:
	@echo depended

depended2:
	@echo depended2

##%
##percent
#`%` equals the regex: `[^/]+`
#it generates a rule only when the input files exists
#or can be made by another rule
#try:
#- `make percent/a.elf`: 	a
#- `make a.elf`:			no rule because no input (`%` does not do `/`)
#- `make percent/b.elf`:	works because `b.c` is generated by another rule
percent/%.elf: percent/%.c
	@echo "percent/%.elf"
	#the `%` part:
	@echo "$*"

percent/b.c:
	touch percent/b.c

clean:
	percent/b.c
