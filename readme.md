this dir contains lots of linux related info and cheatsheets.

it also contains *tools* that can be used in linux (and possibly in other OSs too)

take tools in a very wide sense that include:

- programs

- programming languages

those tools are kept in this repo because:

- they don' deserve a repo of their own because I don't have enough info written on them.

- it is difficult to say where the tool ends and linux begins.
