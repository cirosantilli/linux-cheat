info and cheatsheets on linux and *utils* that work on linux

# definition: utils

by *utils* I mean:

- programs

- programming languages

- libraries

either standard to linux or not

# other os

many of those tools may be cross platform or have very similar ports for
other OSs so the info here is also useful for other OS.
I have not however tested anything in any os except linux.

# this is the default utils repo

those utils are kept in this repo because
they don't deserve a repo of their own because I don't have enough info written on them.
this is the default place where those tools go to before deserving a repo
