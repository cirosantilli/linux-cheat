# Hello world

Get started:

    autoreconf --install
    cd build
    ../configure
    make
    sudo make install
    autoconf_hello_world
    sudo make uninstall

## What to gitignore on a real project

In normal projects, the files generated by the `autoreconf --install` command are also checked in with Git.

We `.gitignore` them here for minimality.

## Configure

### Installation prefix

    ../configure --prefix="$(pwd)/install"

will install all files in the `install` directory.

This is:

- very instructive to see what is getting built on large projects
- useful to prepare `chroot` environments
